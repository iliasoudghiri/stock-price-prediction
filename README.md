# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a model for predicting future stock prices based on historical data. We will explore various machine learning algorithms such as ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet to find the best model for our task.

### Project Outline

1. Data Collection
We will gather historical stock data from a reliable source like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The data should include daily open, close, high, low prices, and volume for a chosen stock or set of stocks. We will collect at least five years of historical data for our analysis.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values or outliers, if any.
Convert the raw data into a time series format, indexed by date.
Create features that could help improve model performance, such as moving averages, RSI, or MACD.
Normalize the data to ensure that the features have similar scales.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
3. Modeling
We will experiment with various machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices. The models we will explore include:

ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting library)
For each model, we will:

Train the model on the training set and fine-tune its hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE),and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices to assess the model's performance visually.
4. Model Comparison and Selection
After training and evaluating each model, we will:

Compare their performance based on the evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, and RMSE).
Choose the model that performs the best on the test set as our final model for predicting stock prices.
5. Deployment
Once we have selected the best-performing model, we will deploy it as a web application or API, depending on the desired use case. This will enable users to input a stock symbol and a date range, and receive predicted stock prices for that period.
